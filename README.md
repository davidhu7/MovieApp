# Pikkr

The best app to help you and your friends choose a movie to watch together! Tailored for movie-lovers who enjoy a relaxing group movie night, the Pikkr android application saves headaches from endless arguments by creating an efficient browsing and voting system for movies, with a simple swipe. 

# How it works

Programmed in java using android studio, Pikkr utilizes the FireStore SDK to create a movies database, keeping track of the titles, production years, descriptions as well as the unique 6-digit codes for individual rooms. 
From the home page, the user can either create a room specifying the number of people and types of genres, or enter a room using a 6-digit code. Once everyone joins, the user can start swiping to vote for movies (swiping right for yes, and left for no). At the end, the application will calculate and present the winning movie!

# Upcoming Features
